# Introduction

## Here are the steps to do before you run the script:

* Install Python on Windows (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2715/) / Ubuntu users would have it already installed(version 2.7).
* Install Pip on Windows (https://github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb/wiki/Python-&-pip-Windows-installation) / Ubuntu users would do using sudo apt-get install pip
* Install AWS CLI on Windows (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/awscli-install-windows.html) / Ubuntu users would do using pip install awscli --upgrade
* Install Boto using: pip install boto3
* Run the following to configure aws: aws configure

Once the pre-requisits are installed, then starts the excution.



## Here are the different examples to run the file:

* Select all rows from a path where column _88 is VIEW_DETECTED and get [1st column, 2nd column, 20th coulmn] from the schema, as well save it to a file 'feed.csv", then we would run it using the following â€“ query: "select _1, _2, _20 from s3object s where _88 = 'VIEW_DETECTED' "

```python
python s3_executor.py -b "bucket-name" -p "path/to/files/" -d TAB -s "select _1, _2, _20  from s3object s where _88 = 'VIEW_DETECTED' " -o feed.csv
```


* Select all rows by applying filter on Http Referral URL, where if we want to select the 2nd column and 3rd column with http_referral (5th column) has value with like '%it.eurosport.com%' -- query: "select _2, _3 from s3object s where _5 like '%it.eurosport.com%' "

```python
python s3_executor.py -b "bucket-name" -p "path/to/files/" -d TAB -s "select _2, _3 from s3object s where _5 like '%it.eurosport.com%' " -o feed_for_eurosport.csv
```
